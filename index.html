                <div><p>Hello hello! My name is Julia and welcome to my life. </p>
                <p>I want my life to be my art and every moment to make me feel. I wouldn't be who I am today without the art or music. The indie folk 
                    ballades and piano etudes. Or the Hope II painting by Gustav Klimt that hangs in the MoMa and the Art Nouveau posters by Alphonse Mucha that remind me that art is always intentional.</p>
                <p>I want a gentle life -- filled with so much love and laughter. The sun and the ocean. A notes app full of half-written stories and painting ideas. I want to spend the day swimming, eating fruit, 
                    reading and smiling in the sunlight -- go biking after dinner and feel inspired.</p>
                <p>I want to take pictures of beautiful strangers and stay up late painting while listening to my new favorite song on repeat over and over again. I want to cry, laugh and scream and sing.
                    I want to sing loudly and dance and fill my life with people who will hold my 
                    hands and spin. </p>
                <p>I want to write mediocre poetry and hopefully a novel. I want to be confident enough
                    to read them out loud.</p>
                <p>And most importantly of all, I want to love. </p>
                <p>With all the love and joy the world has to offer, Julia </p>
