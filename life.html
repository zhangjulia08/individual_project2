                    <h2>Dream Wedding Destination</h2>
                    <p>At the end of 2019, my family and I went to Greece for winter break and visited the ancient city of Delphi where the mythical 
                        Oracle of Delphi is said to be found. Many travelers from distant lands would trek hundreds of miles to visit the Oracle. As a 
                        huge fan of Greek Mythology, visiting this ancient site felt surreal. More than that, no one ever told me how beautiful the ruins are alone.
                        Amidst the soft tender grass and tumbled stones are small yellow flower with pale honey colored centers. Their abundance made the ruins look covered
                        in yellow speckles and silvery olive trees also dot the land. Listening to the sond "In My Sheets" and "The Days that Are to Come" By John Vincent III, 
                        it was the most perfect and euphoric experience like I was living inside a film. It would be an absolute dream to elope at this site in the future.

                    <h2>Butterflies</h2>
                    <p>Last winter break, I had just finished my first semester of college and had never felt more alone and melancholy in my entire life. I never knew how much 
                        of an impact my twin sister and family had on my life and that once I was separated from them, learning to recoup was one of the most challenge experiences I have 
                        ever faced. This was my first time reuniting with my family for an extended period of time and I was able to finally lift my head up from all the stress of first 
                        semester and college life and appreciate the beauty beyond everything that takes place in the small town of Ann Arbor. A stranger's beautiful poster of colorful spain_butterflies
                        was worth noting and celebrating.</p>

                    <h2>Love and Flowers</h2>
                    <p>I used to never really see the value in buying flowers. I've always thought they were beautiful but I used to think about how the money
                        spent purchasing flowers could be reallocated towards buying living plants that could survive for sustained periods of time. My mom used to buy
                        flowers fairly often and I used to think that sometimes it was foolish to do so. This remark that I used to have in my mind is something I'm 
                        not proud of and I wish I could have taken back everything I've ever said to my mother that would criticize these little indulgences she would take
                        part in. Because now, when I have flowers in our college house it definitely makes me happy to see them and remark them for their silent but ever present
                        beauty. The bouquet on the left was sent by roommate's father for his daughter's birthday and the other was given to me by a friend. Both I cherish so much 
                        and I have so much appreciation now for the little things and enjoyments in life such as having a fresh bouquet of flowers on our kitchen table.

                    <h2>Nature and New Jersey</h2>
                    <p>One thing I shamelessly take so much pride in is being from New Jersey and celebrating all the wonderfully overlooked features and quirks this state has to offer. 
                        When people think of New Jersey, nature is rarely the first thing that comes to mind for them but for me it is. I live in the central part of New Jersey where farms
                    and fields dot the town and the most incredible sunsets over take the sky in the warm summer evenings. Living in my house at home and being able to go biking with my sister 
                after dinner and take walks around the park while listening to music outloud is one of my favorite activities in the entire world and I wish I could go back to it sometimes. </p>
